    <p>There’s been a worrying trend where millennials aren’t participating in voting. During the recent election, millennials (ages 18-29) could have made the most powerful impact as millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers as United States’s largest living generation. In the 2012 elections, only 46% of millennials decided to go out and vote. As a result, millennials only made up 19% of the total vote while Baby Boomers were 38% of the total vote. Although the percentage of millennial voters increased during the 2016 elections, there’s still a huge portion missing. Now, the opportunity is to find ways to increase millennial voter turnout.</p>
